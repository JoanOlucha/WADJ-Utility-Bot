Bob command is a old and my first command for this bot.

The apply command is for a server that I own in the future we have to make that the question are cutomizable by server.

Prefix command is currently not 100% working, if a user buts per example !prefix ? the bot will write the file prefixes.json like it schould but then it wont repond to any commands.


Why do you use alot of file? 
What do you mean?

WAD token.json prefixes.json music.mp3 botconfig
